            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Inter-Process Communication (IPC) refers to mechanisms that allow different processes to communicate with each other. These mechanisms are crucial in operating systems for managing process interactions and ensuring efficient data sharing and synchronization.</p>

            <h2>IPC Mechanisms</h2>
            <ul class="mechanism-list">
                <li><strong>Pipes:</strong> Provide a unidirectional or bidirectional communication channel between processes. Pipes are simple and effective for streaming data between processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Message Queues:</strong> Allow processes to send and receive messages asynchronously. Useful for decoupling sender and receiver processes and handling message-based communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> Enables multiple processes to access the same memory region. Provides high-speed data exchange but requires synchronization to avoid data corruption.</li>
                <li><strong>Semaphores:</strong> Used for synchronization between processes to avoid race conditions. Semaphores control access to shared resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Sockets:</strong> Provide communication over a network, allowing processes on different machines to exchange data. Useful for client-server architectures and distributed systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Signals:</strong> Allow processes to send notifications or interrupts to each other. Useful for handling events and asynchronous notifications.</li>
            </ul>
